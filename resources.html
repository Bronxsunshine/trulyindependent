Nishat&#39;s question pained me, I had so many ideas on how to empower women 
but I didn&#39;t want to impose my ideas of feminism onto 
these young 18&#45;year 
old ladies. Especially since I&#39;ve heard so many times feminism is pinned 
to be some sort of &#34;Western Invention&#34; and maybe &#34;rootless&#34;,
and inconsiderate of culture&#34;. I was concerned that I would be 
seen as that  man&#45;hating, family&#45;breaking, hard&#45;as&#45;nails, promiscuous woman&#34;
that feminists are sometimes viewed to be. So I sat with my mouth 
shut and listened. For who 
was I&#63; What did I know about rural Bihari marriage&#63; The answer, 
in short, was&#598;
nothing. I didn&#39;t know a single thing, except for what was reported in the 
news, what was said through the grapevine, and what was assumed&#45; that village
women don&#39;t have much of a say in their marriage, and will need to marry 
early. I wanted to listen to the needs and wants of women in this particular 
setting. I wanted to hear about their uprising. I was ready to help them 
in their uprising. How naive, I thought.
<br><br>    
Feminism is multicultural, diasporic, and 
intersectional, and it&#39;s these very differences in cultures, races, 
economic, and individuality, that will produce different needs. 
It is then addressing those particular needs that will empower 
real women in real time. Jasbir Jain, an Indian author of Indigenous 
Roots of Feminism&#58; Culture, Subjectivity, and Agency, describes feminism 
as more than a voice of protest or questioning. It is 
moral self&#45;reflection, a conquering of inner fears and a 
realisation of self-worth &#40;p. 288.&#41; 
So no, I don&#39;t think women empowerment is one size fits all. We cannot 
interpret history in monolithic universal terms, ignoring the differences 
in culture. So, the question posed &#58;itself how could I make sure that 
I wasn&#39;t invoking Western feminist critique onto the problems that women 
in India faced&#63; 
<br><br>
As women, society often expects some &#45; if not most &#45; our accomplishments 
to be centered around marriage and children. It always seems to creep into 
conversations, even more so as you get older. So I wasn&#39;t very surprised 
when Nishat continued to asked, &#34;Ma&#39;am, do you not want a husband 
ma&#39;am?&#34;... for more information please follow this

<div id="subtitle2"><h3>Exposing the Sterotypes</h3></div>
<div class="subresourcemain2">
<div id="writing2"><h7>
Today, anti-Bihari sentiments and discrimination against 
Biharis still exist. On one hand, with 
&#34;issues of social justice and affirmative action, 
Bihar has been a trailblazer in post independent India&#34; 
&#40;Srivastava, 2010&#41;, but on the other, Bihar is still thought of 
as a place, where &#34;everybody avoided visiting and dreaded becoming&#34; 
&#40;Economist, 200s4&#41;, and is now simply considered a land of migrants 
and &#34;buffoons..lacking social skills&#34; &#40;Sinha, 2015 &#41;. That is what 
stereotypes do, they bring a sense of disposability of places but most 
importantly, people.

Stereotypes take time to be altered, for places and people to be 
perceived for what they truly are versus what the world expects them 
to be. We all know that stereotypes limit our learning, not just of those 
who we are stereotyping but of those around us, of ourselves and ultimately
of society. In one way or the other, directly or indirectly, positively or
negatively, stereotypes influence our behaviour, attitude, beliefs and 
ideologies. They limit possibilities, our world and thus the world of 
others.    

<br><br>
This limitation has kept the Bronx and Bihar 
vulnerable &#45; vulnerable to repeat their history or simply continue 
living within the repercussions of their past realities. It&#39;s kept the 
people thinking they might not amount to anything other than the Bronx 
or Bihar &#45;and that&#39;s suppose to be a &#39;bad&#39; thing. 
The Bronx and Bihar&#39;s 
experiences have taught me about a different type of vulnerability&#58; of 
forgotten and misunderstood people. It has allowed me to maneuver in this
world with mindfulness, to never judge a book by its cover and things are 
never what they seem, giving me confidence and comfort with contradiction
because I have indeed found beauty in the so called &#39;ugly&#39;. 
My Bronx has 
and continues to be a dumping ground and Bihar continues to live behind 
its past&#39;s shadow still building but the love people have of these torn 
places remains. What the world expects us to be isn&#39;t what 
we have to be
or even what we are. ... for more information please follow the

It&#39;s not news that by educating girls we can 
uplift an entire country and, one can argue, help eliminate poverty. 
We should educate our girls and women because &#34;a educated girl is 
likely to increase her personal earning potential, as well as reduce 
poverty in her community,&#34;  and pass this on to the next generation to 
have &#34;healthier and better educated children&#34; &#40;Bourne 2014&#41;. It also 
prevents early marriages and allow women to develop skills, knowledge 
and ultimately be empowered to make their own decisions and thus, 
claim their rights &#40;USAID 2015&#41;.  Gayle Smith, CEO of ONE Campaign 
states that, &#34;We know that if we educate girls the developing world 
will yield 308 million dollars per day&#34;s &#40;GPE Secretariat 2018&#41;. 
Yet, educating our girls and women continues to be a difficult task.

MANSI works in many locations but my field visit was specific to Jharkhand, 
Seraikela-Kharsawan district, which is considered one of the poorest districts of 
Jharkhand, where &#34;many villagers must travel arduous distances of up to ten miles for 
healthcare, leading to a widespread practice of home deliveries that deny basic and essential 
care needed to ensure a healthy start to life&#34; &#40;AIF 2018&#41;.

<br><br>
I witnessed firsthand what educating women can do &#45; they can save lives. 
MANSI provides educational training to government appointed Sahiyas who then feel more 
confident and have more technical knowledge to assist in home-based deliveries. MANSI&#39;s Sahiyas 
were taking the training they were provided and helping premature babies live. Meet a few of the 
Sahiyas saving lives in rural Jharkhand, India, which I had the pleasure of interacting with &#58;
